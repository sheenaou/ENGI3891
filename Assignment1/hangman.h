 * function (which is **provided by test code**) can be used to ask the player
 * (or the computer player / test code) which letter should be guessed next.

 *                          (or '*' if the letter is still not known)
 * @param       length      the number of elements in `letters`

/**
 * Check how good a guess is in a game of Hangman.
 *
 * In Hangman, the goal is to guess letters contained in a secret word.
 * For instance, if the word is "applesauce", the player starts out seeing
 * the word as "**********". After guessing 'A', they see, "a*****a***".
 * If they guess 'P', they will see, "app***a***", etc., until they have
 * guessed all of the letters or run out of guesses.
 *
 * The purpose of this function is to evaluate how "good" a guess is:
 * how many letters does it reveal? Where are those revealed letters located?
 *
 * @param[in]  word      the word being guessed
 * @param[in]  letter    the letter being guessed
 * @param[out] letters   the letters in the secret word that have been
 *                       uncovered by the guess: if letter i is revealed,
 *                       it should be set to the same value as word[i]
 *                       (letters not revealed by the guess are not changed)
 *
 * @pre `word` is spelled in all lower-case letters
 * @pre `letters` has at least as many elements as `word`
 *
 * @returns    how many times the guessed letter was found

/**
 * Play a game of Hangman.
 *
 * This function should repeatedly call getNextGuess() to get the player's next
 * guess, then use guessLetter() to check how good a guess it is. The function
 * should end when either a) the secret word is completely revealed or
 * b) the player runs out of guesses.
 *
 * @param       word      the secret word being guessed by the player
 * @param       maxWrong  how many guesses the player can get wrong before
 *                        the game ends
 *
 * @returns     true if the word was guessed, false if we ran out of guesses
